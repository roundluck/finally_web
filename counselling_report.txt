Introduction 
This report presents the complete development lifecycle and architectural details of the 
Student Counselling Appointment System, developed as part of the IN6225 Enterprise 
Application Development module. The project was designed to allow students to conveniently 
schedule appointments with university counsellors. It features secure login, appointment 
management, calendar integration, and real -time availability checks. The project follows a 
layered architecture using modern frontend and backend frameworks, with a microservices -
ready structure. 
Project Objectives and Scope 
The primary objective of the Student Counselling Appointment System is to create an efficient, 
user-friendly digital platform that simplifies the process of booking, managing, and attending 
counselling appointments for university students. It eliminates ma nual booking, reduces 
administrative workload, and ensures secure, role -based access to critical functionality for 
both students and counselors. 
The scope of the system includes: 
• Secure user authentication using JWT for students and counselors. 
• Slot-based appointment booking with a cap of 3 students per time block. 
• Dashboard functionalities personalized for different roles. 
• ICS file generation for calendar integration. 
• Automated email confirmations on successful bookings. 
• Logical and aesthetic user interfaces that enhance usability. 
• REST API-driven backend with full CRUD support for appointment records. 
System Features and Architecture 
 
 


===== Page 3 =====
 
The application is developed based on Layered (N -Tier) Architecture , ensuring the 
separation of responsibilities and ease of maintenance. This consists of: 
• Controller Layer: Responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests. 
• Service Layer: Hosts core business logic and inter-service communication. 
• Repository Layer: Manages persistence using Spring Data JPA. 
• Entity/DTO Layer : Models domain objects and transport objects for external 
communication. 
• Security Layer: Uses JWT filters and Spring Security configurations. 
Design Patterns Applied: 
• DTO Pattern : Used extensively to encapsulate the structure of requests and 
responses. 
• Builder Pattern: Employed via Lombok's @Builder annotation for object construction. 
• Singleton Pattern: Spring-managed beans default to singleton lifecycle. 
• Factory Method Pattern: Implemented through Spring’s @Bean configurations. 
• Strategy Pattern: Underlying mechanism used by Spring Security for authentication 
flow. 
• Proxy Pattern: Leverages Spring AOP for aspects like transaction management. 
• Template Method Pattern: Enabled through extending JpaRepository. 
 
Technology Stack and Tools Used 
Layer Technologies / Libraries 
Frontend React.js, Bootstrap 5, Vite, Axios, JavaScript 
Backend Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, JavaMail 
Database MySQL, Hibernate ORM 
Development IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, MySQL Workbench, Postman 
Deployment Tools Git, GitHub (public repository) 
 
Backend Implementation 
The backend is a robust Spring Boot application with distinct layers organized for scalability 
and testability. Key components include: 
• Controllers: Handle endpoints for appointments, students, counselors, and 
authentication. 

===== Page 4 =====
• Services: Implement logic like JWT generation, slot validations, and appointment 
filtering. 
• Repositories: Provide abstraction over data access using JPA. 
• DTOs: Models such as AppointmentRequestDTO and AppointmentResponseDTO 
bridge the frontend and backend. 
• SecurityConfig.java: Defines access policies, password encoding, and JWT filter 
chains. 
Additional integrations: 
• JavaMailSender for confirmation emails. 
• Swagger for API testing (configurable). 
• Exception handling via global advice classes. 
• Input validations with Hibernate Validator. 
 
Frontend Implementation 
The React -based frontend leverages componentization, Bootstrap styling, and modern 
practices: 
• LoginComponent.jsx: Authenticates user and stores tokens. 
• HeaderComponent/FooterComponent: Static navigational elements. 
• BookAppointmentComponent.jsx: Enables date and slot selection, validates 
booking. 
• ViewAppointmentsComponent.jsx: Displays sorted appointment data. 
• EmailConfirmationModal.jsx: Shows popup on successful booking. 
• TokenUtils.js: Decodes JWT to extract role and user info. 
Highlights: 
• Axios used for secure API interactions with Authorization headers. 
• .ICS generation and download for calendar clients. 
• Modal confirmation UI with automated reset logic. 
• Color-coded UI for appointment statuses. 
• Role-based PrivateRoute protection of routes. 
 
Database Design 
Database: appointments_db 
Tables: 
• users: Contains login credentials (username, password, role). 

===== Page 5 =====
• students: Contains personal info and FK to users. 
• counselors: Stores counselor details and FK to users. 
• appointments: Core appointment data including FK to students and counselors.

REST API Structure 
 
 
Challenges Faced and Resolutions 
• Slot Booking Overlap : Multiple students tried booking same time slot. → 
Implemented slot availability check. 
• Frontend Role -Based Routing Confusion : /appointments used by both roles. → 
Split logic and filtered by JWT role. 
• JWT Malformed Error: Occurred when token expired or corrupted. → Added robust 
error handling in TokenUtils. 
• MySQL FK Errors: FK constraints broke insertions. → Reordered inserts and ensured 
user_id presence. 
• React Render Failures : Component crashed on null objects. → Defensive 
programming using optional chaining. 
• CORS Issues : Backend rejected frontend requests. → Configured CORS in 
SecurityConfig. 
• Static File Imports: ICS and image attachments caused build errors. → Switched to 
Blob creation and dynamic links. 
• Email Failures: SMTP error or auth failure. → Enabled App Password in Gmail and 
reconfigured JavaMailSender.

Scope for Future Enhancements 
• Session History: Enable viewing past appointments with counselor remarks. 
• Calendar View UI: Display appointments in a visual calendar component. 
• Multi-role Admin Panel: Monitor system-wide activity, add/edit users, change roles. 
• Bulk Email Notification: Reminders before appointments. 
• ICS Import Functionality: Read external calendar inputs. 
• Email Templates: Beautify current plain-text messages. 
• Mobile Responsiveness: Improve UI for smaller screens. 
• Token Expiry Notification: Alert users when session is close to expiry. 
 
Lessons Learned 
• Emphasized best practices in Spring Boot like separation of layers, stateless APIs, and 
dependency injection. 
• Learned to integrate full-stack technologies—React, Bootstrap, Spring Security. 
• Solved real-world challenges in routing, authentication, and concurrent access. 
• Appreciated test-first development and modular component design. 
• Realized the importance of exception-safe coding in backend and frontend. 
• Improved GitHub repository hygiene by separating backend and frontend and adding 
clear READMEs. 
• Gained confidence in working with cloud services (JavaMail/Gmail App Password).
